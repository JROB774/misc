- sort visible sprites from back-to-front then draw them to avoid z-order issues (dont do this till we get better level format where entities are their own thing)

- resource manager:
    - don't like how i've done resource manager so will update it again (will mostly be the same)
    - do resource loading on a separate thread and implement a load screen at startup and between areas
    - properly handle resources and stuff as currently we leak memory
    - add in the cache_all functionality
    - hotloading

- developer console
- level editor (use tein/mew-genics as base):
    - implement things system
    - make game use new area format
    - save changes prompt on quit!!!

- calculate fps and draw it to the bottom-right corner of the game

- lighting:
    - implement depth/fog for areas (not really lighting but im putting it here)
    - add fading to the lighting
    - implement materials
    - add ability for multiple light caster objects

- bugs:
    - fix the issue with memory leaking

- get started on an audio system:
    - look into better alternatives to SDL_Mixer (so we can do proper 3d sound and have better control of aspects such as pitch, etc.)
      OpenAL-Soft seems like it'll be good for what we want and doesn't seem *too* difficult based on this example:
        - OpenAL-Soft example: [https://cranialburnout.blogspot.com/2012/08/openal-soft-demonstration-of-binaural.html]
        - OpenAL-Soft: [https://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html#release]
    - sound effects should be placed in their own SOUNDS catalog
    - music should be placed in its own MUSIC catalog
    - for now don't really need anything specific just playing sounds and music and testing out OpenAL
