                Unofficial 'The End is Nigh' Level Editor
                v0.1.5

- OVERVIEW ---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a program used to edit levels for the game 'The End is Nigh'. You will
need a copy of the game to obtain the assets and files neccessary to modify the
game. This software hopes to provide a more streamlined and useful editor than
the existing one, with brand new features, visuals, and tools to make editing
levels easier. For more information on how to use the software and more, read
the following sections below.

- HOW TO USE -------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply run the application and begin using the tools provided to modify and
create new levels for the game. Info on particular features and tools are as
follows:

- SETTINGS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Currently there is no way to modify the settings within the editor itself. If
you would like to modify a setting please do so manually using the settings.dat
file. The names are human-readable and can be modified easily using a program
such as Notepad.

Note, most settings will not take effect until the editor is restarted.

- THE TILE PANEL - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The tile panel is the large panel on the left-side of the editor. It contains
all the tiles that can be placed in the game. They are split into three sections,
categories, groups, and indiviudal tiles.

Categories are the different sections, marked with title text over the top of
each one, grouping tiles of similar types.

Groups are the individual graphics visible in each category, they group together
variants of the same tiles, usually directional variants (up, right, down, left,
etc.).

Tiles are the different variants that make up each group, the currently selected
tile in a group is represented as the graphic of the group.

For information on how to scroll through and select tiles within groups, go to
the HOTKEYS AND CONTROLS section. These tile groups can also be selected simply
by clicking on them.

- THE HOTBAR BUTTONS - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

If level data is lost or saved over, looking in the backups folder may be
helpful, as a previous version of the level will most likely be saved there.

By default, the backups folders will store 3 saves per level, however, this value
can be changed by modifying the settings.dat file.

- PLANS FOR FUTURE VERSIONS ----------------------------------------------------

An options menu where settings can be modified properly.
Smart draw for faster multi-directional tile-placement.
Rebindable keys and a wider variety of settings available.
More functionality with the select tool (move, flip, rotate current selection).
Optimisation and general improvements / bug fixes.
And more!

If you have any suggestions for future features, please let me know in TEIN Public
Discord Server: @JRob774

- REMARKS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently when packing/unpacking a GPAK the editor will stop responding until
the task is complete. This will be resolved in a future update but is entirely
normal for now.
